==========
XXX	forward the telnet port so that a user gets connected to a primetime process
	make primetime a TCP server that can accept connections and print the lines to each socket;
		see the "tcp" unit - I think that's built-in to CHICKEN
		smart would be to compute the factors once and forward that info to each listener
	count prime freq and compare to Euler's Totient function - keep a running average of # of primes
	log prime events - Primetimes, twins, gaps, etc.
XXX	Twin primes
XXX	Cousin primes (p, p+4)
XXX	Sexy primes (p, p+6)
XXX	prime triplets (p, p+2, p+6) (p, p+4, p+6)
XXX	prime quadruplets (p, p+2, p+6, p+8)
	Commemorate when 911, 31337 come up as a factor
XXX	C C C Combo breaker!
XXX	ensure clock is set to UTC, or that I'm getting the UTC Epoch time
