Idea blog:
==========
	make primetime a TCP server that can accept connections and print the lines to each socket;
		see the "tcp" unit - I think that's built-in to CHICKEN
		it would be smart to compute the factors once and forward that info to each listener
	count prime freq and compare to Euler's Totient function - keep a running average of # of primes
	log prime events - Primetimes, twins, gaps, etc.
	Commemorate the moment when interesting numbers such as 911, 31337, etc. appear as a factor
        ** *** PRIME ******* *********** CONSTELLATION *****************"
        ** *** 31337 FACTOR! *********** ************* *****************"
XXX	256 colors - taste the rainbow
XXX	forward the telnet port so that a user gets connected to a primetime process
XXX	Twin primes
XXX	Cousin primes (p, p+4)
XXX	Sexy primes (p, p+6)
XXX	prime triplets (p, p+2, p+6) (p, p+4, p+6)
XXX	prime quadruplets (p, p+2, p+6, p+8)
XXX	C C C Combo breaker!
XXX	ensure clock is set to UTC, or that I'm getting the UTC Epoch time
